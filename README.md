# Another Rhythm Game,

named "Another Rhythm Game"?

Do you want something new, something rhythm, and something, that isn't "osu!" or "Friday Night Funkin'"?

Want to relax, and make your own game palette for your eyes? Want a non-standard kind of rhythm game?

Well, here it is!  A rhythm game made by 3 people: 2 coders and 1 artist and musician, with their own music, idea, and more! Do you want to be funky?

Beat and Hit!
